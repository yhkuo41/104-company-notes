     _(Not good to find a company to demo low rating style, you can try to use their own. Highlighting in black/grey can help to avoid certain companies, which might be the most common usage of this plugin ü§î.)_

   ‚ùó Notes for the same company will overwrite each other. To prevent your own notes from being overwritten by imported notes, export your notes first, import the others, and then re-import your own.

3. To convert notes to spreadsheet format, use online tools like [JSON to XLSX](https://www.google.com/search?q=json+to+xlsx) or [JSON to CSV](https://www.google.com/search?q=json+to+csv). You can also convert from CSV to JSON, but be mindful of formatting, field names, and encoding issues.
